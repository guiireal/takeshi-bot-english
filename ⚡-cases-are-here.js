/*
 * If you clicked here, it's because you probably already used a bot with "case" and an "index.js" of 20 thousand lines...
 * I know, I understand you!
 * What's better? Getting an error in your "play", going to the "play.js" file and fixing it
 * or going to line 71023 of "index.js" and fixing it?
 *
 * Imagine if you paste your "case" wrong and forget to close
 * or open a parenthesis, a brace...
 * You start the bot, it gives you several errors and you don't know how to solve them...
 * Guess what you do?
 * You go back to the "index.js" you had before, right?
 *
 * That's what we don't want! We want clean, readable and easy-to-maintain code!
 * We create code for humans, not for machines, so the simpler, the better!
 *
 * From now on, let's change the word "case" to "command", ok? Let's go!
 *
 * ---------------- 🤖 WHERE ARE THE COMMANDS? 🤖 ----------------
 *
 * You'll find the commands inside the "src/commands" folder
 * Don't understand? Let's see!
 *
 * Open the "src" folder
 * Then, open the "commands" folder
 *
 * Notice that inside it there are 3 folders:
 *
 * - 📁 admin
 * - 📁 member
 * - 📁 owner
 *
 * Inside the "admin" folder there are administrative commands.
 * Inside the "member" folder there are commands for members.
 * Inside the "owner" folder there are commands that only the bot/group owner can access.
 *
 * Simple, right? Oh, one detail: you don't need to put an "if" to know if the command is admin or owner.
 * The bot already does it for you! You just need to place the command in the corresponding folder!
 *
 * ---------------- 🤖 WHERE DO I MODIFY THE MENU? 🤖 ----------------
 *
 * Open the "src" folder
 * Go to the "menu.js" file and edit the menu!
 * Just remember, do everything inside the backticks (`), as it is a template string!
 *
 * Don't understand?
 * Look:
 *
 * `Hello, how are you!` - This is CORRECT ✅
 *
 * Hello `how are you?` - This is INCORRECT (notice that "Hello" is outside the quotes) ❌
 *
 * ---------------- 🤖 HOW DO I CHANGE THE BOT'S PHOTO? 🤖 ----------------
 *
 * Open the "assets" folder
 * Then, open the "images" folder
 * Replace the "takeshi-bot.png" image with another one of your preference!
 * Just don't forget to keep the name "takeshi-bot.png"
 *
 * ---------------- 🚀 IMPORTANT 🚀 ----------------

 *
 * Don't skip steps! Read it completely, as it's very important for you to understand how the bot works!
