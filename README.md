## Common errors

### Operation denied when extracting folder

The error below occurs when downloading the ZIP file directly on the phone with some versions of ZArchiver apk and also on phones without root.

To resolve it, follow the [installation tutorial via git clone](https://www.google.com/search?q=%23installation-on-termux).

![common error 1](./assets/images/erro-comum-1.jpg)

### Deleting session files and reconnecting

If any error occurs in the connection, you can delete the files inside the `/assets/auth/baileys` folder.

```sh
rm -rf ./asset/auth/baileys
```

Then, remove the device from WhatsApp by going to WhatsApp settings in "linked devices".

Add a new device again.

### Permission denied when accessing `cd /sdcard`

<br/>

![common error 2](./assets/images/erro-comum-2.png)

Open Termux, type `termux-setup-storage` and then accept the permissions.

## ‚ö† Disclaimer

In this project, I had to host `node_modules` to help those who run the bot from their phone, as many of them might not run `npm install` correctly through Termux.
